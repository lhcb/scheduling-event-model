# TransformAlgorithm Playground

The setup-lhcb-build.sh script in this directory will checkout versions of Gaudi, LHCb,
Lbcom, Rec and Brunel from a git branch dedicated to playing around with 'TransformAlgorithm'.

The aim of 'TransformAlgorithm' is to demonstrate one can

1. remove explicit TES interactions from non-framework code 
-  make algorithms 'const' during the event loop
-  pass input and output 'by const reference' resp. 'by value' without loss of efficiency

The above results in

1. less 'boiler plate',
-  more uniform 'look and feel'
-  naturally provides a more 'declarative' style of coding
-  code which is more 'future proof', i.e. it can
    +  be wrapped in futures
    +  be run asychonously
    +  allow for automatic scalar to vector adaption
            (i.e. 'user' only needs to provide scalar operation)


The corresponding JIRA task is [GAUDI-1132](https://its.cern.ch/jira/browse/GAUDI-1132). If you have
suggestions and/or requests, please add them to this JIRA task.

The changes can be shown by going into the Rec directory, and
comparing the 'Paris2015-baseline' tag and the 'HEAD' of the Paris2015 branch,
eg. 'git diff Paris2015-baseline HEAD'.

In case you don't want to check out the code in git, you can see the differences
directly on gitlab using the following URL:

https://gitlab.cern.ch/graven/Rec/compare/Paris2015-baseline...Paris2015

or in a (nicer) side-by-side view:
