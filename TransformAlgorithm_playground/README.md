# TransformAlgorithm Playground

The setup-lhcb-build.sh script in this directory will checkout versions
of Gaudi, LHCb, Lbcom, Rec and Brunel from a git branch dedicated to 
playing around with 'TransformAlgorithm'.


The aim of 'TransformAlgorithm' is to demonstrate 
    - one can remove explicit TES interactions from non-framework code
    - one can make algorithms 'const' during the event loop
    - one can pass input and output 'by const reference' resp. 'by value' without
      loss of efficiency

The above results in 
    - less 'boiler plate', 
    - more uniform 'look and feel'
    - naturally provides a more 'declarative' style of codeing
    - code which is more 'future proof', i.e. it
         +  can be wrapped in futures
         +  can be run asychonously
         +  can allow for automatic scalar->vector adaption
            (i.e. 'user' only needs to provide scalar operation)


The changes can be shown by going into the Rec directory, and
comparing the 'Paris2015-baseline' tag and the 'HEAD' of the Paris2015 branch,
eg. 'git diff Paris2015-baseline HEAD'.

In case you don't want to check out the code in git, you can see the differences
directly on gitlab using the following URL:

or in a (nicer) side-by-side view:
